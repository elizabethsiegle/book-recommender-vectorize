Historically-researched and riveting. Love the syntax and the way it flows.<br/><br/>I think the main theme of the book questions and connects the relationship between languages, translation, and colonialism.<br/><br/>Can be slow to start and can get long, but it's a fun, interesting, deep, thought-provoking historical fiction novel that will make some readers uncomfortable and question what they thought they knew about words, languages, certain countries and colonialism, race, power, home, family, and gender.<br/><br/>Prior to reading this, I thought translation was fairly easy. Not that I could translate many things into or from other languages besides English, but I thought it meant finding an equivalent or equal in another language.<br/><br/>Kuang shows how great translation allows for innovation in the target language and delves into how the meanings of words change over time and how the roots can be connected and dissected and traced back to different meanings and histories.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

I appreciate the Asian diversity (Eliza's family is Chinese from Vietnam, the male protagonist is Japanese-White), her best friend is Black, and there's some LGBTQ representation as well.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the representation of Asian immigrant parents and how Eliza's mom looks down on her dad's restaurant job--this seems realistic in terms of how a marriage is portrayed as well as of how many Asians work in the industry! <br/><br/>It was fun to see Boba Bros (a play on Boba Guys?) and I felt that plotline could have been explored more. <br/><br/>There were some twists and turns, but ultimately I loved the portrayal of self-growth and collective growth as Eliza's classmates realized they were, indeed, misogynistic.",,,1,0

Clearly, the topic resonates with a lot of people.<br/><br/>The book is chock full of facts, quotes, and anecdotes, but moves quickly. It flows/reads well and is easy to read (probably because I'm a millennial and felt like I could relate to a lot of the stories.)<br/><br/>I like how the book touches on the root cause of burnout, looking at the history of labor and unions and our parents (boomers.) It touches on parenting, college, the over-working culture in Japan, and the dwindling middle class, providing an informative and fun look at the history, present, and future.",,,1,0

I know I usually can't put books down, but legend was especially different. I am now obsessed and loved Day and June, the main characters who are easy to relate to. With more mystery and suspense than most dystopian romances, (ie hunger games, divergent, matched, etc) this book will appeal to more types of people. Obviously, a must-read. Can't wait for the movie and sequel! ",,,1,0
